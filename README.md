# Password Generator

## Description

This webpage was designed to help the user create a password that meets certain ciriteria.
This webpage was made to generate a strong password that provides greater security.
In this project I was able to create a serious of prompts for the password criteria along with the password length. Then I created a function for every prompted confirmed so that whatever criteria the comfirmed is the one that would show up once the password was generated.
with this projected I learned how valueable functions are when preforming specific task. I also learned how important it is to have things spelled right for your code to work.
